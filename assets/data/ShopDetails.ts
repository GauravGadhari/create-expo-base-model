    bio: `Welcome to "MeTulsiTereAanganKiBinaTelKeDiyaJalakeToDikha"!
Where code meets chaos, and nothing makes senseâ€”except maybe a few lines of JavaScript. If you're into coding, laughing at errors, and wondering how you ended up debugging at 3 a.m., this is your happy place.
Expect coding tutorials, random tech rants, and occasional attempts at serious programming. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just here for the name, we've got a bug waiting for everyone. Come for the code, stay for the absurdity!`,
